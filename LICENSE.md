You may not use any assets or code from this project, WITHOUT asking direct permission.

 A lot of this project uses content that the rights of are reserved to Enigmatica Modpacks, if the content asked to be used is orignally created by me I will likely allow the use of it.

All assets and code related to "emendatus" or "EmendatusJS" ASIDE from recipes, are under MIT licensing, as the assets come from the original mod under MIT and the code was originally created by myself (deepacat).
