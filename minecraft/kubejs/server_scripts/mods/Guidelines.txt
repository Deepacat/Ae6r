All mod folders must match their mod id
Each file should match a recipe types id, with mod namespace before it

Before a recipe is added, if it is to an item with an existing recipe that is to be removed,
and the recipe is not to be removed by a regex or recipe filter, it should be removed right 
before the recipe is created
