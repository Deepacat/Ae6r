Note not all listed is complete, alot of ideas are still to be implemented and or improved!

Notable major differences:
    - Mod changes:
        - RS replaced with Ae2 and addons, although Ae2 will progress fairly differently.
        - Astral sorcery removed, new magic progression points using Embers and Wizards reborn.
        - Atum is unavailable and I'm frankly not a fan, it has been replaced with the Aether and some addons, with a new slightly different aspectus shard system replacing it and being integrated into more recipes.
        - Away with drawers and iron chests to make room for sophisticated storage!
        - Apotheosis being nerfed and reworked. New bosses only being based on strong enemies you can't so easily get away with cheesing, like iron's spells mages, with everything about it being tweaked to not be as comically strong.
        - Newer Create... and plenty other updated mods like Ars of course!
        - Tetra removed, I am not the biggest fan of it personally.
        - Gear overhaulled! Typical enchantable items requiring more effort and magical touch to craft, encouraging more use of tinkers construct gear now with their new armor system. (The sequenced and mechanical armor crafts are gone.)
    - A much expanded questbook, attempting to keep the mistique of E6E's quests not giving much info and being more lore/flavor focused, giving enough to go off of so it's not annoying.
    - Questbook is also re-layed out! Removing the not so accurate main gates chapter, and attempting to make quest dependencies make alot more sense.
    - Introducing a Tips quest tab with purchasable tip quests! Costing materials to unlock information on how to do something for those who may be stuck with something, or feel like they could be doing it better. (No this will not replace base mod guides!) All without needing to visit the discord and ask around (or maybe we don't have a tip for that and you ask anyway, could make a new tip!)
    - Reworked/replaced several mastery shards. Along with expanding upon them and their concepts, making sure at least each shard fits 2 mods or a fair amount of items into their categories.
    - Too many custom KubeJS interactions because I am addicted to making custom scripts to challenge myself!
    - Custom multiblocks featuring more mechanics than just a bigger grey box with hatches using Multiblocked2
