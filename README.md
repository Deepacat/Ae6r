Aenigmata 6 Resurgere: A port/reimagining of Enigmatica 6 Expert for 1.20.1

Ae6r is "heavily inspired" by E6e using alot of it's recipes and concepts, but is still very different with several mods added and removed

With major reworks to progression, Ae6r aims to maintain a similar endgame and overall feel to the original
