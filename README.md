Aenigmata 6 Resurgere: A re-imagining of Enigmatica 6 Expert for 1.20.1

Ae6r is "heavily inspired" by E6e using alot of it's recipes and concepts, but is still very different with several large mod and progression changes along with recipe tweaks to make it a bit more difficult or balanced, all while still trying to maintain the overall feel of E6E.

[Planned and completed differences in design and progression from E6E to Ae6r](https://github.com/Deepacat/Ae6r/blob/master/information/e6eDifferences.md)

This project is in no way affiliated with Enigmatica Modpacks! It is an entirely unofficial fan project made from passion to see it renewed and refreshed (With permission)
