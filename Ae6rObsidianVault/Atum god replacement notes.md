Deepa - Replacing the godshards from the atum is an interesting task, each of the 15 godshards are uniquely used for at least one recipe, I think it's unnecessary to keep all of these gods especially after removing the whole Egyptian themed dimension lol, for now I think replacing the godshards with some items relating to more broad categories such as the gods powers work, I am looking at correlating gods to thaumic aspects and picking my favourites of the group to keep, aiming to lower the total count

ok looking at gods is boring and they make no sense I'm gonna base on mf skylanders elements to thaum aspects

aspect thoughts 1 -
	Air - Aer
		Related to air, flight, the sky
	Dark - Perditio
		Related to night, shadows, chaos
	Earth - Terra
		Related to ground, depths, rock
	Fire - Ignis
		Related to Fire, heat
	Life - Herba > Victus (Victus makes more sense word wise but Herba is more on theme)
		Related to plants, life force, nature
	Light - Ordo
		Related to light, order, purity
	Magic - Praecantatio
		Related to magic, the arcane
	Tech - Metallum | Machina? Metallum is lower tier and fits better as a general aspect
		I think might just cut this one
	Undead - Mortuus
		Related to death, the undead
	Water - Aqua
		Related to water, the aquatic, bodies of water

thoughts 1
	In total down to 9 from 15, not counting tech/metallum which would be 10 but I don't think it's fitting enough for a magic item
	Although this causes too much overlap with botania runes, more elemental items....
	Considering instead doing *Norse* godshards, aligning with the theme of the aether being another realm of magic involving botania, and botania is already based on Norse mythology, but it is difficult to correlate similar categories for the shards
