E6e nuked sulfur ores, its obtained solely obtained through other processing methods
(Just removed several ores)

E6e doesn't have raw ore materials like 1.18+, theyre all "chunk" items, but in my version I'd like to use raw materials for metals and chunks for raw gems, though these chunks are not obtainable through ores for gems, only the occultism dimensional mineshaft, these chunks also use the ore tag
