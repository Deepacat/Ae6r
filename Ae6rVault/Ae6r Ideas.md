Aether
- Move archwood forest biome to the aether with thermal blazes (remove from overworld)
	- use snowcapped and disable areo/terrablender for overworld to add biome

Add "Dwarven Mithril" The endgame material of embers, the original dev intended this to only be lootable from a custom structure but I think that's kinda lame, I'd rather have it be obtained from like some kind of upgraded ember bore multiblock drilling that outputs embers but also bedrock dusts with traces of raw mithril in them, which would require a processing chain to refine into full, usable Dwarven Mithril

Remove ae2 meteors, make an end structure of a crashed alien ship which would have certus in it used to create your own certus buds (remove obtaining flawless buds) structure located with wand in mainhand and meteorite compass in offhand (non consumed)

It'd be really funny if possible to make it so you can do piglin bartering with endermen lol?? They could give you random alien/end items and skystone (presumably scavenged from alien ships) that could be used for meteorite compass to find ships if you can't find without locating one, what would you barter an enderman with though? I think I removed all end ores along with better end, maybe I could recreate one

I think I want to include hexcasting at least a little in dark arts mastery, so Add hexcasting quest chapter that has quests to explain basic mechanics of the mod, with it gating hidden quests behind enlightenment phases Add purchasable tips quests on enlightenment steps that show a diagram to solve the step and explain each part/pattern of it Add a mindflaying purchasable tip quest, giving directions on how to use flay mind and automating its use
