Move archwood forest biome to the aether (remove from overworld)
Add a sort of overgrowth biome to the aether? similar to lush caves but ofc not caves, would have the flutter from alexs mobs naturally spawn there (flutter related to magic progression)

Mobs to add to aether:
	flutter
	mimicube?
	thermal blazes (not vanilla blaze) (maybe just to archwood forest?)
