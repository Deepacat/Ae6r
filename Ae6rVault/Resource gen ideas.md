Complicated bees rework ideas
- Remove all default bees
- Remove locational trait requirements
- Add bees based on magic Aspecti
- Breed primal aspectus bees into further forms (Vitreus bee from ordo and terra, Metallum bee from vitreus and ordo, iron bee from metallum bee infused with iron or something)

Splendid slimes rework ideas (nearly identical to complicated bees)
- Remove all default slimes
- Add slimes  based on magic Aspecti
- Rework plort press slime heart forming
- Process primal aspectus slimes into further forms (Vitreus slime from ordo and terra, Metallum slime from Vitreus and ordo, iron slime from metallum slime infused with iron or something)
- Create custom mbd2 multiblocks for splendid slimes similar to apiary to have non entity slimes for performance and ease of use
- Item forms of slimes to be used in apiary, these item forms take plenty of plorts to create so that you can't bypass the slimes in world mechanics and still have to use them normally for a while before converting to an apiary usage

General thoughts
Would probably want to either keep both resource gen mods, with splendid slimes being early and bees being later but stronger, but this causes an odd overlap along with potential switch
OR 
Just keep splendid slimes and rework it entirely with adding custom mbd2 multiblocks to work like apiaries and reduce lag by removing slime entities, optimally apiary forms of slimes would cost a bunch of the plorts from the normal slimes so that you still have to use them in world for a bit instead of just bypassing their mechanics entirely

Tying aspects to biomes for finding resource mobs
Aer- Aether Archwood forest
Aqua - Aether cold biomes
Ignis - Aether Archwood forest
Terra- Undergarden
Ordo - Aether
Perditio - Undergarden
Mortuus - Undergarden
Cognitio - Aether (make an arcane wood forest/wizreborn biome)
Praecantatio - Archwood forest, arcane wood forest

(Primal slime spawning)
These biomes could spawn the slimes as mobs normally, use the splendid slime spawner chute feature things, or could be a block that generates randomly in which you'd have to use something on to create a slime from, or collect the block and form the slime from it elsewhere

(Complicated bee spawning)
well it'd just be primal aspect bee nests I guess
