Deepa - Replacing the godshards from the atum is an interesting task, each of the 15 godshards are uniquely used for at least one recipe, I think it's unnecessary to keep all of these gods especially after removing the whole Egyptian themed dimension lol, for now I think replacing the godshards with some items relating to more broad categories such as the gods powers work, I am looking at correlating gods to thaumic aspects and picking my favourites of the group to keep, aiming to lower the total count

Anput (god of the afterlife female)
Anubis (god of the afterlife male)
Atem/Atum (god of.. creation and the universe)
Geb (god of the earth)
Horus (god of the sky)

ok looking at gods is boring and they make no sense I'm gonna base on mf skylanders elements

Air - Aer
	Related to air, flight, the sky
Dark - Perditio
	Related to night, shadows, chaos
Earth - Terra
	Related to ground, depths, rock
Fire - Ignis
	Related to Fire, heat
Life - Herba > Victus (Victus makes more sense word wise but Herba is more on theme)
	Related to plants, life force, nature
Light - Ordo
	Related to light, order, purity
Magic - Praecantatio
	Related to magic, the arcane
Tech - Metallum | Machina? Metallum is lower tier and fits better as a general aspect
	I think might just cut this one
Undead - Mortuus
	Related to death, the undead
Water - Aqua
	Related to water, the aquatic, bodies of water

In total down to 9 from 15, not counting tech/metallum which would be 10 but I don't think it's fitting enough for a magic item

Although this causes too much overlap with botania runes, more elemental items....

Considering instead doing *Norse* godshards, aligning with the theme of the aether being another realm of magic involving botania, and botania is already based on Norse mythology
